This report explores approaches to build a "Class Activation Map" around objects. To do this, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a face/no-face dataset first to classify images, and then, we can generate heat using the weights trained by the CNN.

Feel free to take a look at the PDF file for the report, or if you want to play around with the source, the Jupyter Notebook is also attached. Reach out to us if you have any questions!
